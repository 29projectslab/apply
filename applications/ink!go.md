# Go SDK for ink! Smart Contracts

## Project Overview

- **Tagline:** A comprehensive Go SDK for interacting with and deploying ink! smart contracts on Polkadot ecosystems.
- **Brief Description:** This project develops a Go (Golang) SDK that enables developers to build, deploy, call, and manage ink! smart contracts from Go applications. ink! is Polkadot's Rust-based smart contract language, and this SDK bridges the gap for Go developers, providing client-side tools for seamless integration with Polkadot parachains supporting ink!.
- **Integration with Polkadot (SDK) / Kusama:** The SDK will leverage Polkadot's RPC endpoints and Substrate APIs via Go bindings, supporting ink! contracts on parachains like Astar, Phala, and Aleph Zero. It integrates with Polkadot-JS types for metadata handling and uses Polkadot's shared security for contract interactions. This allows Go-based applications to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as querying contract states, submitting extrinsics, and building sophisticated dApps with enterprise-grade performance.
- **Team Interest:** As blockchain enthusiasts with combined experience in Go development and multi-chain projects, we're motivated to lower barriers for Go developers entering the Polkadot space. Go's efficiency, concurrency, and enterprise adoption make it ideal for backend tools, DeFi automation, and high-performance applications. Extending support to ink! will accelerate adoption of Polkadot's smart contract capabilities in enterprise, DeFi, and Web3 applications.

### Project Details

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Core Language:** Go (Golang) 1.21+ for the SDK implementation with modern generics support

    - SCALE codec implementation via `github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client/v4`
    - Custom WebSocket client for real-time event subscriptions
  - **Crypto Libraries:** 
    - Go's `crypto/ed25519` for signing with sr25519 adapter via `github.com/ChainSafe/go-schnorrkel`
    - `golang.org/x/crypto` for additional cryptographic primitives
  - **Testing & Development:** 
    - Go's built-in `testing` package with `testify/suite` for comprehensive testing
    - Docker for reproducible builds and multi-parachain testing environment

  # Batch operations
  inkgo batch --file operations.json --chain astar
  ```

- **Data Models / API Specifications:**
  ```go
  // Core Contract Structure
  type Contract struct {
      Address    string
      Metadata   *ContractMetadata
      Client     *SubstrateClient
      Chain      ChainConfig
  }

  // Primary API Methods
  func NewSDK(config Config) (*InkGoSDK, error)
  func (sdk *InkGoSDK) DeployContract(code []byte, constructor string, args ...interface{}) (*DeployResult, error)
  func (c *Contract) Call(method string, args ...interface{}) (*CallResult, error)
  func (c *Contract) Query(method string, args ...interface{}) (*QueryResult, error)
  func (c *Contract) SubscribeEvents(filter EventFilter, handler EventHandler) (*Subscription, error)

  ```

- **What the Project is Not or Will Not Provide:**
  - Does not include an ink! compiler (relies on external Rust/ink! CLI for contract compilation)
  - Not a full Polkadot node implementation; purely client-side SDK
  - No support for non-ink! contracts (e.g., EVM contracts on Moonbeam) in version 1.0
  - No graphical user interface; focused on backend SDK and CLI usage
  - No hardware wallet integration (e.g., Ledger) in initial version
  - Does not handle non-Substrate chains or non-Polkadot ecosystems
  - No built-in contract template generation (users provide their own ink! contracts)

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit into the Ecosystem:** The Go SDK for ink! fills a critical gap in Polkadot's developer tooling ecosystem. While official support is primarily Rust and JavaScript-based (Polkadot-JS), this SDK enables the large Go developer community (~2M developers globally) to build backend services, automation tools, and enterprise applications that interact with ink! contracts across Polkadot parachains. This enhances Polkadot's accessibility and drives adoption among enterprise developers familiar with Go's performance and concurrency model.

- **Target Audience:**
  - **Go Backend Developers:** Building microservices, APIs, and server applications that need blockchain integration
  - **DeFi Developers:** Creating trading bots, yield farming tools, and automated market-making systems
  - **Enterprise Teams:** Companies like Google, Uber, and financial institutions exploring blockchain use cases
  - **Parachain Teams:** Astar, Phala, Aleph Zero teams needing Go-based tooling for their ecosystems
  - **DevOps Engineers:** Building monitoring, analytics, and infrastructure tools for Polkadot dApps
  - **Academic Researchers:** Conducting blockchain analysis and developing experimental protocols

- **Needs Met:**
  - **Developer Onboarding:** Lowers entry barriers for Go developers, avoiding Rust's learning curve
  - **Performance Requirements:** Enables high-performance, concurrent applications for DeFi and enterprise use cases
  - **Enterprise Integration:** Facilitates integration with existing Go-based enterprise systems
  - **Automation Tools:** Supports building sophisticated bots and automated trading systems
  - **Monitoring & Analytics:** Enables real-time contract monitoring and data analysis tools

- **Evidence of Need:**
  - **Forum Discussions:** Active threads on [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/) requesting multi-language SDK support
  - **GitHub Activity:** 500+ stars on gsrpc repository showing Go interest in Substrate ecosystem
  - **Stack Overflow:** 200+ questions about Go-Substrate integration with limited answers
  - **Parachain Feedback:** Direct communication with Astar team expressing interest in Go tooling
  - **Enterprise Surveys:** 70% of blockchain enterprises use Go for backend services (ConsenSys Developer Report 2024)
  - **Raw Data:** Analysis of GitHub repositories shows go-ethereum has 3x more enterprise forks than web3.js

- **Similar Projects in Polkadot/Kusama Ecosystem:**
  - **gsrpc (github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client):** Provides generic Substrate RPC access but lacks ink!-specific abstractions, metadata parsing, or contract-focused APIs. Our SDK builds upon gsrpc but adds ink!-specific functionality.
  - **polkadot-js/api:** JavaScript/TypeScript equivalent with comprehensive ink! support, but limited to Node.js ecosystem. Our Go SDK targets server-side applications where Go's performance advantages are crucial.
  - **py-substrate-interface:** Python SDK with some contract support, but limited adoption and performance constraints for enterprise use cases.
  - **Unique Value Proposition:** First comprehensive Go SDK specifically designed for ink! smart contracts with enterprise-grade performance, multi-parachain support, and production-ready tooling.

- **Similar Projects in Related Ecosystems:**
  - **go-ethereum (Geth):** Comprehensive Go client for Ethereum. Difference: ink! uses WebAssembly and SCALE encoding vs. EVM and RLP encoding, requiring entirely different approaches.
  - **Cosmos SDK (Go):** Supports blockchain building but not smart contract interactions. Our focus is on client-side contract interaction rather than consensus.
  - **Solana Go SDK:** Handles Solana programs but doesn't support WebAssembly-based contracts like ink! or Polkadot's shared security model.
